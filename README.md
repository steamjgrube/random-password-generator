# random-password-generator

## Created functionality on a site to randomly generate a password based on 4 critera.

## User gets to choose the desired size of their password

## User is able to choose if they would like Uppercase & Lowercase characters, as well as numbers and symbols.

## If the user chooses no critera, the prompt closes.



### had some formatting issues causing my script to break, but was able to resolve to problem. Some feedback on my layout/format would be appreciated.
